**Mars Rover kata**
You have been asked to create a program to move rovers around the surface of Mars! The surface of Mars is represented by a Plateau, you can make the assumption that the Plateau is a square/rectangular grid for the purpose of this task. Rovers navigate the Plateau so they can use their special cameras and robot arms to collect samples back to Planet Earth.

**Assumptions:**
The surface is square/rectangular
The coordinates begin at 0,0
The rovers only move forwards one square at a time
Cannot go over the side of the plateau - no minus numbers
Rovers cannot occupy the same area
Rovers turn 90 degrees so can only move vertically and horizontally
Each L or R instruction is only 90 degrees
Movement instructions can only be made up of "LRM"
